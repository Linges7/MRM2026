Effective immobilisation must include the wrist in ~15–20° extension plus the thumb CMC and MCP in palmar abduction, because the tendons cross the radial styloid and are loaded by wrist motion. A long opponens splint is forearm-based and includes the wrist — hence it is the thumb spica used for de Quervain. A. Wrist cock-up — immobilises the wrist but leaves the thumb free; the thumb motion is the provocative one. B. Short opponens — hand-based, positions the thumb but does not cross the wrist. Used for thumb CMC osteoarthritis and median nerve palsy (to maintain the thumb web space). It undertreats de Quervain. C. Finger gutter splint — for digital/phalangeal injury; irrelevant. Note: Some question banks key this as \"short opponens\" on the logic that the thumb is the problem. The clinical literature and hand-therapy standard is the forearm-based (long) thumb spica.

CPP is the parameter that directly determines cerebral blood flow, and is therefore the single most critical threshold for preventing secondary ischaemic injury. A. MAP > 100 mmHg — MAP in isolation is meaningless without knowing ICP; aggressive MAP augmentation risks ARDS (the \"CPP > 70\" strategy was abandoned for this reason). B.

Treatment: restart dopaminergic therapy urgently (NG tube, rotigotine patch, apomorphine), plus supportive cooling and hydration. A. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome — same phenotype, but NMS is caused by adding a dopamine antagonist. Here the cause is withdrawal of a dopamine agonist. The distinction matters because it dictates the treatment (give dopamine back, rather than stop the offending drug). This is the intended discriminator. B. Serotonin syndrome — requires serotonergic drug exposure and features clonus, hyperreflexia, mydriasis, diarrhoea, not lead-pipe rigidity. C.

In secondary insufficiency ACTH is low, so there is no pigmentation. Post-TBI hypopituitarism is a recognised and under-diagnosed cause of rehabilitation plateau. A. Orthostatic hypotension — occurs in both forms (cortisol is permissive for vascular catecholamine responsiveness). Non-discriminating. C. Improvement with glucocorticoid replacement — occurs in both.

    "explanation": "This is metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) — a neuro-oncological emergency. High-dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 16 mg/day, often with a 8–10 mg loading dose) should be given immediately on clinical suspicion, before and without waiting for imaging. Steroids reduce vasogenic oedema and can preserve neurological function during the hours it takes to arrange MRI and oncology/neurosurgical review. Neurological status at the time of treatment is the single strongest predictor of final outcome — every hour matters. A. Bladder drainage — must also be done (a tender palpable bladder needs catheterising), and is genuinely urgent for comfort and renal protection. But it treats a symptom; it does nothing to preserve the cord. The definitive answer to \"most appropriate immediate management\" is the intervention that changes neurological outcome. B. Neuropathic analgesia — supportive only. D. Urgent CT of the whole spine — wrong modality. The investigation of choice is urgent whole-spine MRI within 24 hours (NICE: within 24 h, or sooner if neurology is progressing). CT is a fallback only if MRI is contraindicated. Also, imaging follows steroids, not the reverse.\nReference: NICE NG234 (formerly CG75) \"Spinal metastases and metastatic spinal cord compression\" (nice.org.uk, free); StatPearls, \"Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression\"; Braddom Ch. 53 \"Rehabilitation of Patients with Cancer\".",

    "explanation": "Parietal cells in the gastric body and fundus produce intrinsic factor. Total gastrectomy removes them entirely, so IF cannot be secreted, and B12 cannot be absorbed at the ileal cubilin/amnionless receptor. The result is B12 deficiency → megaloblastic (macrocytic) anaemia with hypersegmented neutrophils. It manifests after hepatic B12 stores deplete — typically 2–5 years, though earlier with pre-existing low stores. D. Impaired cleavage of B12 from dietary protein — this does happen post-gastrectomy (loss of gastric acid and pepsin, which liberate B12 from food protein), and is the mechanism of food-bound B12 malabsorption in atrophic gastritis and PPI use. But after total gastrectomy, the absolute loss of intrinsic factor is the dominant and complete mechanism — cleavage failure alone would still permit absorption of crystalline B12. This is the intended discriminator. B. Reduced pancreatic protease activity — pancreatic proteases release B12 from haptocorrin in the duodenum; a real mechanism in chronic pancreatitis, not gastrectomy. C. Decreased ileal absorption — the mechanism in Crohn's disease or ileal resection. The ileum here is intact; the problem is upstream.\nReference: StatPearls, \"Vitamin B12 Deficiency\"; Stabler SP. \"Vitamin B12 deficiency,\" N Engl J Med 2013 (PubMed).",

Gabapentin (typically 100 mg post-dialysis, titrated cautiously) has the best randomised evidence of the listed options. (Difelikefalin, a kappa-opioid agonist, is the newer licensed agent where available.) B. Oral antihistamine — the instinctive answer and the wrong one. Uraemic pruritus is not histamine-mediated; antihistamines are largely ineffective and any benefit is sedation. The stem's \"phosphate already optimised\" is the clue that you must move beyond the standard first steps. A. Systemic corticosteroid — no role; unacceptable long-term toxicity for a chronic symptom. C. Opioid analgesic — mu-opioid agonists worsen pruritus. Actively counterproductive.

The immediate management step is decompression and prevention of aspiration — \"drip and suck\": nil by mouth, IV fluids, and an NG tube on free drainage to decompress the proximal bowel. In a patient with SCI the aspiration risk is higher (impaired cough, possible impaired sensation masking the severity), making early NG decompression more, not less, urgent. A. Rectal examination — mandatory and should be done, but it is part of assessment, not management; the stem asks for the immediate management step. (It is, however, the step people most often skip — in a chronic SCI patient with neurogenic bowel, faecal impaction is a leading differential.) B. Urgent surgical referral — necessary, and should happen in parallel, but referral is not itself a resuscitative manoeuvre; you stabilise while you refer. D. Urgent abdominal X-ray — an investigation, not management. Note: if your faculty's key says A, the reasoning will be that in neurogenic bowel you must first exclude impaction/pseudo-obstruction before anything else. Both defences are clinically sound; the discriminator is whether the examiner reads \"management\" strictly.

    "correct_option": "D",
    "explanation": "The phrase \"despite adequate lung expansion\" tells you inspiration is intact — as expected, since the diaphragm (C3–C5) is preserved at C6. The deficit is in the expulsive phase: the abdominal muscles (T6–T12) and internal intercostals are paralysed below C6, so the patient cannot generate the rapid rise in intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure needed for an effective cough. Hence secretion retention, atelectasis and pneumonia — the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cervical SCI. Management: assisted cough (quad cough), mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, abdominal binder. B. Diaphragmatic paralysis — the diaphragm is innervated C3–C5 and therefore intact at C6; and the stem explicitly says lung expansion is adequate. Direct contradiction. C. Reduced chest wall compliance — intercostal paralysis does reduce compliance and contributes to restrictive physiology over time, but it is a contributing, chronic factor, not the mechanism of a weak cough with preserved inspiration. A. Impaired coordination due to disrupted spinal reflexes — vague; the problem is paralysis of specific muscle groups, not discoordination.\nReference: Braddom Ch. 49 \"Spinal Cord Injury\" (respiratory function by level); Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine, \"Respiratory Management Following Spinal Cord Injury\" (free PDF).",

They are visible on non-contrast CT (the modality of choice) and, importantly, are the stone type amenable to medical dissolution by urinary alkalinisation with potassium citrate. B. Calcium oxalate — the commonest stone and the most radio-opaque. C.

These are extremely potent bronchoconstrictors, mucus secretagogues and vascular permeability agents. Loss of the bronchoprotective PGE₂ brake compounds the effect. Treatment: avoid all non-selective COX inhibitors; leukotriene receptor antagonists are logically and clinically effective. A. Increased thromboxane A2 — TXA₂ is a COX product and is therefore reduced, not increased, by diclofenac. C. Reduced prostacyclin (PGI₂) — also a COX product and genuinely reduced; but PGI₂ is a vasodilator/antiplatelet mediator, and its loss explains NSAID cardiovascular risk, not bronchospasm. D. Reduced prostaglandin H2 synthesis — true (PGH₂ is the COX product), but it is a restatement of the drug's action, not the mechanism of bronchoconstriction. The bronchospasm is caused by what the shunted substrate produces.\nReference: StatPearls, \"Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease\"; Laidlaw TM, Boyce JA.

    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Elevating the head of the bed does two things simultaneously: it concentrates body weight onto the sacrum and coccyx (the interface area shrinks while load increases), and it causes the torso to slide down, generating shear as the skin is held by friction while the skeleton migrates (see Q64). Interface pressure studies consistently show sacral pressure rising steeply above ~30° of head elevation. This is precisely why guidelines cap elevation at ≤30° except when clinically necessary (feeding, ventilation, aspiration risk). A. Full 90° lateral — takes the sacrum off-load entirely, but concentrates pressure on the greater trochanter and lateral malleolus, which is why 90° side-lying is discouraged. C. 30° lateral tilt, bed flat — the recommended repositioning posture: it offloads the sacrum and the trochanter by loading the soft tissue of the buttock. The lowest-risk option listed. D. Supine, bed flat — distributes weight over the largest surface (sacrum, heels, scapulae, occiput). Sacral pressure exists but is substantially lower than at 45° and there is minimal shear.\nReference: EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA International Pressure Ulcer Guideline 2019 (free Quick Reference Guide at internationalguideline.com) — repositioning and 30° recommendations; Braddom Ch. 55.",

Experimental macrophage depletion severely impairs healing; neutrophil depletion does not. The M1→M2 phenotype switch governs the transition from inflammation to proliferation. A. Fibroblasts — the effector cells that respond: they synthesise collagen and ECM and differentiate into myofibroblasts for contraction. They are directed by, rather than directing, the process. B. Platelets — critical initiators: haemostasis plus early release of PDGF and TGF-β from alpha granules in the first minutes to hours. But their role is transient and it is the macrophage that sustains and coordinates the proliferative phase. C. Neutrophils — first responders for debridement and bacterial killing (day 1–3); largely dispensable for healing itself and, if persistent, they perpetuate a chronic inflammatory, non-healing wound.\nReference: StatPearls, \"Wound Healing Phases\"; Gurtner GC et al. \"Wound repair and regeneration,\" Nature 2008 (PubMed); Braddom Ch. 55.",

    "explanation": "This describes the absolute refractory period transitioning into the relative refractory period. - Absolute refractory: essentially all voltage-gated Na⁺ channels are in the inactivated state (inactivation gate closed). They cannot reopen until the membrane repolarises, so no stimulus of any intensity can generate an action potential — exactly what the stem specifies. - Relative refractory: as repolarisation proceeds, Na⁺ channels progressively recover from inactivation, so a stronger stimulus (or a longer interval) can fire an action potential. A. ACh depletion at the NMJ — would be a synaptic phenomenon; the stem describes nerve conduction studies with paired stimuli, i.e. axonal membrane behaviour. ACh depletion also would not fully recover in milliseconds. B. Increased Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase activity — restores long-term ionic gradients over seconds to minutes; far too slow, and it does not determine refractoriness. D. Persistent K⁺ channel opening — delayed rectifier K⁺ efflux causes the afterhyperpolarisation and contributes to the relative refractory period, but it does not produce the absolute refractoriness irrespective of stimulus intensity.

The sympathetic outflow arises from T1–L2; a complete lesion at T4 disconnects most of the splanchnic (T6–L2) and lower limb vasomotor supply from supraspinal control. On sitting, the baroreflex detects the fall in pressure and attempts to respond, but the efferent sympathetic limb cannot reach the vessels — so there is no reflex vasoconstriction of the capacitance vessels or splanchnic bed. Blood pools, venous return falls, and pressure drops. The primary and initiating lesion is the loss of sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow. A. Reduced skeletal muscle pump — a genuine contributory factor (the calf pump normally augments venous return), but secondary; it does not explain the failure of reflex vasoconstriction, which is the primary defect. B. Reduced venous return → reduced preload and cardiac output — an accurate description of the haemodynamic consequence, not the mechanism. The question asks why venous return falls. C. Reduced baroreceptor sensitivity — the afferent limb and the baroreceptors themselves are intact; the lesion is efferent. This is the classic trap.

Preganglionic fibres from the sacral intermediolateral cell column (S2–S4) travel in the pelvic splanchnic nerves (nervi erigentes), synapse in the bladder wall ganglia, and release acetylcholine acting on M3 muscarinic receptors to contract the detrusor. This occurs simultaneously with pontine-coordinated relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (withdrawal of pudendal somatic output) and of the internal sphincter. B. Sympathetic T11–L2 causing detrusor contraction — sympathetic activity is the storage mechanism: β3-adrenergic detrusor relaxation plus α1-mediated bladder neck contraction. The option states the opposite effect. C. Pudendal-mediated external sphincter contraction — that is continence/storage; during voiding, pudendal output is inhibited so the sphincter relaxes. D.

    "explanation": "The clinical phenomenon is a hyperexcitable segmental stretch reflex. Rapid stretch activates muscle spindle Ia afferents, which excite the alpha motor neuron monosynaptically. Following an upper motor neuron lesion, the loss of descending inhibition (see Q78) leaves the alpha motor neuron pool hyperexcitable — through reduced presynaptic and reciprocal Ia inhibition and the development of persistent inward currents in the motor neurons themselves. The result is an exaggerated reflex contraction (the catch) that is velocity-dependent and is absent on slow stretch, which does not recruit the dynamic Ia response. C. Overactivity of the gamma efferent drive — this is the classical textbook explanation, and many older question banks key it. However, microneurographic studies in spastic patients have failed to demonstrate increased fusimotor drive; contemporary reviews attribute spasticity to altered motor neuron excitability and reduced spinal inhibition rather than gamma overactivity. If your faculty's key says C, this is the reason — flag it and cite the discrepancy; it is a legitimate and well-documented point of disagreement in the PM&R literature. - A. Persistent inward currents in dorsal horn interneurons — PICs are real and relevant to spasticity, but they occur in motor neurons (and are mediated by descending monoaminergic drive), not dorsal horn interneurons. - D. Enhanced reciprocal inhibition — reciprocal inhibition is reduced, not enhanced, in spasticity; enhancing it would decrease tone.\nReference: Braddom Ch. 30 \"Spasticity\"; Nielsen JB, Crone C, Hultborn H. \"The spinal pathophysiology of spasticity,\" Eur J Appl Physiol 2007 (PubMed); Trompetto C et al. \"Pathophysiology of spasticity,\" BioMed Res Int 2014 (free full text, PubMed Central).",

Arterial conduits resist atherosclerosis because of endothelial nitric oxide production and a lack of vein-graft-type intimal hyperplasia. LIMA-to-LAD confers a proven survival benefit and is a class I recommendation. C. Great saphenous vein — the standard conduit for non-LAD targets; easily harvested and long, but suffers progressive vein graft disease with much poorer long-term patency. A.

Both active and passive movement are restricted — this locates the problem in the joint itself, not in a contractile (tendon/muscle) structure. 2.

Pathology: fibroproliferative contracture and chronic inflammation of the glenohumeral joint capsule, with the rotator interval, coracohumeral ligament and anterior capsule most affected, producing a globally contracted capsule with reduced joint volume on arthrography. D. Coracohumeral ligament — anatomically the most specific structure limiting external rotation, thickened in the rotator interval and the target of arthroscopic release. It is the most defensible alternative answer.
